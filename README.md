# Making HTML5 slides with Reveal.js and Pandoc

![Pandoc](https://github.com/eLearningHub/presentation-reveal-pandoc/workflows/Pandoc/badge.svg)

This repository generates HTML slides from a Markdown file (`index.md`) using [reveal.js](https://revealjs.com/) and [pandoc](https://pandoc.org/). You can see the slides [here](https://elearninghub.github.io/presentation-reveal-pandoc). Whenever the source file changes, a [GitHub Action](https://github.com/features/actions) updates the slides automatically.

If you want to make your own slides on GitHub, you can [fork](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo) this repository. You may want to change the name of the repository. Make sure to check the GitHub Pages section of the settings of your repository. Choose the `gh-pages` branch from the source menu. If everything goes well, you will see the address of your GitHub page. It should be like: `yourprofilename.github.io/your-repo-name`.
